# AccordianGame
The project is given by my data structures and algorithms class, going in-depth into how to implement a custom stack class, a custom linked link class, and the use of iterators in these classes. The project was an excellent way to learn more about the earliest data structures one knows in DSA courses. The assignment used Linux redirection on the command prompt in visual studio code.
